# 🔐2.1_Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

A simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the most well-known classical encryption techniques. This program allows you to **encode** or **decode** messages using a customizable shift value.

---

## 📜 About

The **Caesar Cipher** is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of `3`:
- **Plaintext**: `HELLO`
- **Ciphertext**: `KHOOR`

This tool allows encoding and decoding with both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters, preserving non-alphabetic characters like punctuation and spaces.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Encode a message with a given shift
- ✅ Decode a message with the same shift
- ✅ Handles both upper and lower case letters
- ✅ Ignores and preserves spaces, numbers, and symbols

# 💰2.2_Indian Currency Formatter

This is a simple Python program that formats any floating-point number into the Indian numbering format, inserting commas at the correct positions (Lakhs, Crores, etc.).

---

## 📜 Problem Statement

In the Indian numbering system, large numbers are grouped differently compared to the Western system. This project takes a floating point number as input and converts it into a **comma-separated Indian currency format**:

- Thousand → 1,000  
- Lakh → 1,00,000  
- Crore → 1,00,00,000  

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Accepts user input (float)
- ✅ Formats integer part with Indian grouping (3-2-2 pattern)
- ✅ Preserves decimal places
- ✅ Returns a properly formatted string
